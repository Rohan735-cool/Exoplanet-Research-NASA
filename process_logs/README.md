This folder contains raw photos of the research process, documenting the iteration of data visualizations from initial histograms to final density estimates.
These four photos show the main steps of my work, but they are only a small part of the whole process. I tried many other versions on different plots with different settings which I didn't capture on my device. I'm also not able find all of the images I had captured initially.
